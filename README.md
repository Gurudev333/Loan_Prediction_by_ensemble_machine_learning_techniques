# Loan_Prediction_by_ensemble_machine_learning_techniques
•The goal is predict status of customer using loan and customer information.<br/>•It
includes tasks such as data visualization, cleaning, transformation, feature
engineering. <br/>•The ensemble learning techniques such as voting, boosting,
bagging are used. <br/>•In this case in voting decision tree, logistic regression,
support vector machine are used as base learners. <br/>•The random forest
(bagging), Gradient boosting (boosting) are used, voting method gives better
performance. <br/>•Libraries used are sklearn, matplotlib, pandas, and numpy.
